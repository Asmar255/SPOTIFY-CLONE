# SPOTIFY-CLONE
This is my first project—a Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on creating a clean and functional interface that resembles Spotify’s layout. The project is also fully responsive, ensuring it adapts smoothly to all electronic devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones.
